        //      1. An interval is a range represented by two numbers like (5, 8)
        //      2. The two numbers are termed as - start and end.
        //      3. Example - Time interval in tasks or jobs - 
        //              a = (1, 3)
        //              b = (4, 5)
        //              c = (8, 10)
        //              d = (9, 11)

        // Overlapping Intervals - https://youtu.be/2ZLl8GAk1X4?t=136142
        // Relationship between two intervals a and b
        //      1. a and b do not overlap.
        //      2. a and b overlap, b ends after a.
        //      3. a completely overlaps b.
        //      4. a and b overlap, a ends after b.
        //      5. b completely overlaps a.
        //      6. b and a do not overlap.
