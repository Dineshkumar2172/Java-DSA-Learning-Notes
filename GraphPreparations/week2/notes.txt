Dijkstra's:

    1. Single source shortest path algorithm - based on greedy algorithm.
    2. It can be implemented using three methods:
        i) Priority Queue (it's time consuming, but better than queue)
       ii) Set (It's the fastest comparing to others)
      iii) Queue (it's time consuming)
