Dijkstra's:

    1. Single source shortest path algorithm - based on greedy algorithm.
    2. Supports only positive weighted graph's - doesn't work on negative weights.
    2. It can be implemented using three methods:
        i) Priority Queue (it's time consuming, but better than queue)
       ii) Set (It's the fastest comparing to others)
      iii) Queue (it's time consuming)

    1. Single source shortest path algorithm - based on dynamic programming.
    2. It supports both positive and negative weighted graphs. (Slower than Dijkstra but handles negative weights)
    3. However it doesn't work on negative weighted cycle. So we need to ensure the graph doesn't contain negative weighted cycle.
    3. It works only on DG's. In order to make it work on UDG's, we have to create equivalent reverse edge for all nodes.
