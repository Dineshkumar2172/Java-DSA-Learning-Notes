Primâ€™s Algorithm Overview
    1. Finds Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected, weighted, and undirected graph.
    2. Greedy approach: Always picks the minimum-weight edge that expands the MST.
    3. Uses Priority Queue (Min-Heap) to optimize selection of the smallest edge.
    4. Expands from a selected vertex
    5. Fails while handling disconnected graphs (cannot start MST on all components)

Kruskal's Algorithm Overview
    1. Works on both connected & disconnected weighted graphs.
    2. Greedy + Union-Find (Edge-based)	(union find reference - https://youtu.be/aBxjDBC4M1U)
    3. Picks the smallest edge (globally)
    4. Finds an MST for each component separatel
