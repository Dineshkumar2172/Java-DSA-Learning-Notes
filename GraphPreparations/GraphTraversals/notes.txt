BFS and DFS naturally handles cyclic, acyclic, directed, undirected, connected and disconnected graphs.


There is not separate implementation for each of these types of graphs.

There are two ways to implement DFS and BFS. They are

    1. iterative

    2. recursive.


Though iterative with adjacency list is enough as it's more memory efficient.
