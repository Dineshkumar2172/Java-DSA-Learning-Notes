         *      1. TrieNode[] children - An array which refers to other TrieNodes in Trie, also called as
         *         child nodes of a TrieNode. The size of array is usually taken as 26 (if we are storing english words)
         *      2. boolean isWord - A boolean value to indicate the end of word. This value is set as true
