        //      1. Hashing is a technique used for storing, retrieving and removing information as quickly as possible.
        //      2. It's a process of converting a arbitrary size key into fixed sized value. The conversion is
        //         done via a special function called Hash function.
        //      3. The operation supported by hashing such as storing, retrieving and removing information have average
        //         runtime complexity of O(1).

        // What are Hash Functions? - https://youtu.be/2ZLl8GAk1X4?t=125912
        //      1. A hash function simply takes an arbitrary size key and provides fixed size value also called as index.
        //      2. Commonly used hash function - modular hash function  - https://youtu.be/2ZLl8GAk1X4?t=126086
        //              i. A modular hash function simply takes a key and size of array, returns remainder by dividing key by size.
        //             ii. The remainder is used as an index to store the key in an array of provided size.
