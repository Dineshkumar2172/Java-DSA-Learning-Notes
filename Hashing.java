        //      1. Hashing is a technique used for storing, retrieving and removing information as quickly as possible.
        //      2. It's a process of converting a arbitrary size key into fixed sized value. The conversion is
        //         done via a special function called Hash function.
        //      3. The operation supported by hashing such as storing, retrieving and removing information have average
        //         runtime complexity of O(1).
