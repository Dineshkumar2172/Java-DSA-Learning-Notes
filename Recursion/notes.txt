what is recursion? when a function calls itself, until a specified condition is met.


assume we have function like below


void func(i) {
    sout(i);
    func(i+1);
}

infinite recursion will happen creating infinite number of stack and run of out memory - stack overflow.


So, we need to keep so condition in place - based on which recursion call stops getting executed - base condition

assume we added base condition

void func(int n) {
    if (n <= 12) return;

    sout(n);
    func(n + 1);
}


the above function will print until 12 from the given number and stop executing once it reaches 12.
